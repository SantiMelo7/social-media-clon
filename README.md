## Getting Started

- In this project I learn everything related to Prisma - Postgress. Within it, I highlight my learnings obtained in general and add to the code of the original video, a little of my ideas when programming, creating components, interfaces, etc. The original idea, the profile and the video are in the repository.

This project was taken from the video -> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyV12oBDsYI>
